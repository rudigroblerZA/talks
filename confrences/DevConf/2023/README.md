## Abstract  
This talk offers an accessible yet comprehensive exploration of ChatGPT and modern language models. It walks attendees through the evolution from traditional NLP techniques to generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), with a focus on the transformer architecture that powers ChatGPT. Combining humor, technical depth, and live demos, the session illustrates how developers can integrate ChatGPT into their apps, understand the technology’s capabilities and limitations, and consider the ethical and safety concerns surrounding large language models (LLMs).

## Summary  

### The Foundations
- The landscape of **virtual assistants** and natural language processing (NLP) has evolved, with GPT models representing a major leap.
- NLP combines computer science, AI, and linguistics to enable machines to process human language.
- NLP tasks include: text classification, summarization, translation, entity recognition, question answering, text generation, and more.

---

### Language Models
- Traditional models: RNN, GRU, LSTM — issues like vanishing gradients, slow training, limited parallelism.
- GPT is based on the **transformer architecture**:
  - Uses attention mechanisms to focus on relevant input parts.
  - Handles sequences using positional encoding.
  - Supports encoder-decoder for translation/summarization.

---

### GPT’s Growth and Performance
- The transformer architecture (from “Attention is All You Need”, Vaswani et al. 2017) allows scaling to massive models.
- GPT’s size and training data volume enabled it to pass challenging exams (e.g. BAR, USMLE, CPA).
- Demonstrates proficiency in science, technology, programming, law, medicine, and more.

---

### Real-World Integration
- Demo showed how to query OpenAI’s API using JavaScript + `fetch` to build a simple web app.
- Discussed use cases:
  - Real estate assistant
  - Educational tool
  - Developer assistant
- Settings like temperature control model output randomness.

---

### Risks and Concerns
- Risks: plagiarism, hallucinations, disinformation, outdated info, economic disruption, overreliance on AI.
- Security issues: prompt injection, jailbreaks (e.g. Bing/Sydney case), and prompt engineering attacks.
- Ethical challenges: ensuring responsible use, protecting privacy, and avoiding harmful content generation.

---

### Final Thoughts
- GPT and ChatGPT provide transformative tools for developers.
- With great power comes responsibility: we must leverage these tools ethically, safeguarding user privacy and societal values.
