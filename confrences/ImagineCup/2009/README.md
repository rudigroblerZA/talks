# Imagine Cup 2009 - Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio

This presentation by Rudi Grobler of Barone, Budge & Dominick introduces Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio (MRDS) 2008 as a powerful platform for student competitors in the Imagine Cup. The session highlights how MRDS's visual programming environment and simulation tools enable rapid development of complex robotics applications, perfectly suited for the innovation-focused Imagine Cup competition.

## Detailed Summary

### Core Components
1. **CCR (Concurrency and Coordination Runtime)**
   - Simplified asynchronous programming model
   - Message-passing architecture with dispatchers and arbiters
   - Enables complex parallel operations essential for robotics

2. **DSS (Decentralized Software Services)**
   - Service-oriented architecture for robotics
   - Supports request/response and notification patterns
   - Enables distributed robot control systems

### Key Features for Imagine Cup Competitors
- **Visual Simulation Environment**
  - Prototype algorithms at home
  - Test in simulation before lab deployment
  - Includes pre-built robot models

- **Visual Programming Language**
  - Lowers barrier to entry for students
  - Drag-and-drop development of robot behaviors
  - Integrates with traditional code

### Competition Advantages
- **Rapid Development**
  - Case study: Complex application in 2 months vs 1 year with traditional tools
  - Reusable components accelerate prototyping

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - Works on mobile, embedded, desktop and server
  - Aligns with Imagine Cup's diverse challenge categories

### Educational Value
- Teaches modern concurrent programming patterns
- Encourages service-oriented design thinking
- Provides professional-grade tools to students

## Implementation Guidance
1. Start with simulation to test concepts
2. Use visual programming for quick prototyping
3. Transition to code for advanced functionality
4. Leverage CCR for competition-critical parallel operations
