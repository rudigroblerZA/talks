This presentation explores the application of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern within the context of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, emphasizing its benefits for building rich, maintainable, and testable user interfaces (UIs). The session provides an in-depth analysis of MVVM components—Model, ViewModel, and View—and illustrates how data binding, commanding, and separation of concerns facilitate a clean UI architecture. It discusses the differences between rich and poor models, highlights the importance of design tools like Visual Studio and Blend, and introduces the Basic XAML Framework (Bxf), a lightweight toolkit to streamline MVVM implementation across Silverlight, WPF, and Windows Phone 7. Practical demonstrations, resource links, and best practices guide developers in adopting MVVM effectively while minimizing reliance on code-behind and enhancing collaboration between designers and developers.

This presentation provides an in-depth overview of security considerations and best practices for developing and deploying Microsoft Silverlight applications. It covers the various vectors through which Silverlight applications can be compromised, including client-side vulnerabilities, network security, and intellectual property protection. The session discusses strategies for securing the client, protecting assets such as code and XAML, and safeguarding data stored locally or transmitted over the network. Emphasis is placed on obfuscation techniques, authentication mechanisms, cross-domain access policies, and secure service communication. Additionally, it explores different approaches to protecting Silverlight application files (XAPs) via authentication, encryption, and domain policies, as well as securing WCF Data Services and network requests using browser and client HTTP stacks. Practical demos and best practices aim to help developers enhance the security posture of their Silverlight applications.
